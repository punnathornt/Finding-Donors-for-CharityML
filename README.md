# Finding-Donors-for-CharityML
This code shows how to construct a supervised learning model on Census Income Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
The objective of the model is to predict individuals' income group so that CharityML, which is a non-profit organization, reach out to the group of donors who are more likely to donate.
CharityML believes that the individuals who make more than $50,000 are their targets.
